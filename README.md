# Investment Calculator @ Reactjs

## Takeaway Learning

The ReactJS Investment Calculator project was aimed at creating a user-friendly web application to help users calculate potential investment returns. The project involved setting up a ReactJS frontend, integrating with backend services, and deploying the application using Vercel.

### Technical Skills Acquired

1. **ReactJS**: Improved my understanding of React components, state management, and hooks. Learned how to structure a React application for scalability. (https://react.dev/learn)
2. **Git and GitHub**: Enhanced my skills in version control, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Learned how to effectively use GitHub for project collaboration and remote repository management.
3. **Vercel Deployment**: Gained experience in deploying a React application on Vercel, including handling environment variables and configuring custom domains.

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **State Management**: Initially struggled with managing state across multiple components. Solved this by implementing the Context API for better state management and data flow.
2. **Deployment Issues**: Encountered errors while pushing to the remote repository due to branch mismatches. Resolved this by renaming the local branch and correctly configuring the remote repository.
3. **Form Handling**: Faced difficulties in handling form validations and submissions. Overcame this by using React Hook Form, which simplified form management.

### Soft Skills Developed

1. **Problem-Solving**: Enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and debug issues efficiently, ensuring a smooth development process.
2. **Time Management**: Learned to prioritize tasks and manage time effectively to meet project deadlines.
3. **Collaboration**: Improved communication and collaboration skills by working closely with team members and using tools like GitHub for version control.

### Future Improvements

1. **Advanced State Management**: Plan to explore Redux for more complex state management needs in future projects.
2. **Testing**: Intend to integrate more comprehensive testing using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code reliability.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Aim to focus on optimizing application performance and improving load times by implementing lazy loading and code splitting.

### Conclusion

The ReactJS Investment Calculator project was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical and soft skills. The challenges faced and solutions implemented have prepared me for more complex projects in the future. I am now more confident in my ability to build and deploy scalable web applications using ReactJS and related technologies.
